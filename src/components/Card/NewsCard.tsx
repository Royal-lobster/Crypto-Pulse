        A closely followed crypto trader is issuing an alert to Bitcoin (BTC)
        holders, saying that the king cryptoâ€™s current market structure looks
        similar to its price action prior to a deep plunge about three years
        ago. Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 566,300 Twitter followers that
        Bitcoin is currently consolidating above a diagonal trendline after
        taking it out earlier this year. According to the trader, the price
        action is reminiscent of how Bitcoin moved in early 2020 when it rallied
        from around $6,000 to $10,000 only to capitulate back to $3,000 in March
        of the same year.
